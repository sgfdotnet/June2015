React JS .NET (June 2015)

This month Tim Franklin presented on a JavaScript framework called React.  It's build and used by Facebook and Instagram and is gaining popularity.

Specifically, Tim discussed:

- the basics of how React works and its concepts
- how JSX works and how you can optionally use it with React
- a demo of the app he used React on (non-.NET) called Connext and how the front-end used Angular JS, and briefly touched on what his team liked/disliked about each
- how you can leverage the ReactJS.NET library (installable via NuGet) to use React with ASP.NET MVC, WebForms, etc.
- the end results of the tutorial from React/ReactJS.NET and how the pieces work together
- the React extension for Chrome that's helpful for debugging
